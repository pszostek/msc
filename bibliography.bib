abstract = {There is a significant need for a realistic dataset on which to evaluate layout analysis methods and examine their performance in detail. This paper presents a new dataset (and the methodology used to create it) based on a wide range of contemporary documents. Strong emphasis is placed on comprehensive and detailed representation of both complex and simple layouts, and on colour originals. In-depth information is recorded both at the page and region level. Ground truth is efficiently created using a new semi-automated tool and stored in a new comprehensive XML representation, the PAGE format. The dataset can be browsed and searched via a Web-based front end to the underlying database and suitable subsets (relevant to specific evaluation goals) can be selected and downloaded.},

abstract = {In the last years, the spread of computers and the Internet caused a significant amount of documents to be available in digital format. Collecting them in digital repositories raised problems that go beyond simple acquisition issues, and cause the need to organize and classify them in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the retrieval procedure. The success of such a process is tightly related to the ability of understanding the semantics of the document components and content. Since the obvious solution of manually creating and maintaining an updated index is clearly infeasible, due to the huge amount of data under consideration, there is a strong interest in methods that can provide solutions for automatically acquiring such a knowledge. This work presents a framework that intensively exploits intelligent techniques to support different tasks of automatic document processing from acquisition to indexing, from categorization to storing and retrieval. The prototypical version of the system DOMINUS is presented, whose main char- acteristic is the use of a Machine Learning Server, a suite of different inductive learning methods and systems, among which the more suitable for each specific doc- ument processing phase is chosen and applied. The core system is the incremental first-order logic learner INTHELEX. Thanks to incrementality, it can continuously update and refine the learned theories, dynamically extending its knowledge to han- dle even completely new classes of documents. Since DOMINUS is general and flexible, it can be embedded as a document management engine into many different Digital Library systems. Experiments in a real-world domain scenario, scientific conference management, confirmed the good performance of the proposed prototype.},

abstract = {We present CiteSeer: an autonomous citation indexing system which indexes academic literature in electronic format (e.g. Postscript files on theWeb). CiteSeer understands how to parse citations, identify citations to the same paper in different formats, and identify the context of citations in the body of articles. CiteSeer provides most of the advantages of traditional (manually constructed) citation indexes (e.g. the ISI citation indexes), including: literature retrieval by following citation links (e.g. by providing a list of papers that cite a given paper), the evaluation and ranking of papers, authors, journals, etc. based on the number of citations, and the identification of research trends. CiteSeer has many advantages over traditional citation indexes, including the ability to create more up-to-date databases which are not limited to a preselected set of journals or restricted by journal publication delays, completely autonomous operation with a corresponding reduction in cost, and powerful interactive browsing of the literature using the context of citations. Given a particular paper of interest, CiteSeer can display the context of how the paper is cited in subsequent publications. This context may contain a brief summary of the paper, another author‚Äôs response to the paper, or subsequentwork which builds upon the original article. CiteSeer allows the location of papers by keyword search or by citation links. Papers related to a given paper can be located using common citation information or word vector similarity. CiteSeer will soon be available for public use.},

abstract = {The automatic document metadata extraction process is animportant task in a world where thousands of documents are just one``click'' away. Thus, powerful indices are necessary to support effective retrieval. The upcoming XML standard represents an important step in this direction as itssemistructuredrepresentation conveys document metadata together with the text of the document. For example, retrieval of scientific papers by authors or affiliations would be a straightforward tasks if papers were stored in XML.Unfortunately, today, the largest majority of documents on the web are available in forms that do not carryadditional semantics. Converting existing documents to a semistructured representation is time consuming and no automatic process can be easily applied. In this paper we discuss a system, based on a novel spatial/visualknowledge principle, for extracting metadata from scientific papers storedas PostScript files. Our system embeds the general knowledge about the graphical layout of a scientific paper to guide the metadata extraction process. Our system can effectively assist the automatic index creation for digital libraries.},

We first describe the groundtruthing task and the requirements for any interactive groundtruthing tool. Next we describe the system design of TrueViz and discuss how a user can use it to create groundtruth. TrueViz is implemented in the Java programming language and works on various platforms including Windows and Unix. TrueViz reads and stores groundtruth/metadata in XML format, and reads a corresponding image stored in TIFF image file format.
