%\section{Choice of the programming language}
%CERMINE was initially created as a part of Yadda (\cite{Yadda}) - a legacy digital library engine. While the choice of the implementation language is an important project decision, when developing our system we were obliged to use the same language as employed in Yadda.
%That being said, CERMINE is implemented in Java. The motivation behind this choice is an easier integration of both products and a wide choice of tools and libraries for Java facilitating implementation of a complex system. What is more, CERMINE is meant to be run using Hadoop, where JVM-based\footnote{Java Virtual Machine} solutions are the most efficient ones.
